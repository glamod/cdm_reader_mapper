Marine data file reader-mapper toolbox documentation
----------------------------------------------------

The **cdm_reader_mapper** toolbox is a python3_ tool designed for both

* to read data files compliant with a user specified data model (**mdf_reader**).
* to map observed meteorological variables and its associated metadata from a data model (schema_) to the C3S CDS Common Data Model (CDM_) format or **imodel** as called in this tool (**cdm_mapper**)

It was developed with the initial idea of reading data from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS_) stored in the International Maritime Meteorological Archive (IMMA_) data format. In the meanwhile, it can read data C-RAID_ Copernicus in situ project too.

The tool has been further enhanced to account for any marine meteorological data format, provided that this data meets the following specifications:

-	Data is stored in a human-readable manner: ASCII_.
- Data is stored in a Network Common Data Format: NetCDF_.
-	Data is organized in single line reports (e.g. rows of observations separated by a delimiter like .csv).
-	Reports have a coherent internal structure that can be modelized.
-	Reports are fixed width or field delimited types.
-	Reports can be organized in sections, in which case each section can be of different types (fixed width of delimited).


The **mdf_reader** uses the information provided in a `data model`_ to read meteorological data into a python pandas.DataFrame_, with the column names and data types set according to each data element’s description specified in the data model or **schema**. In addition to reading, the **mdf_reader** validates data elements against the **schema** provided.

The reader allows for basic transformations of the data. This feature includes `basic numeric data decoding`_ (base36, signed_overpunch) and numeric data conversion (scale and offset).

Several data models have been added to the tool including both the IMMA and the C-RAID schema.

.. note:: **Data from other data models than those already available can be read, providing that this data meets the basic specifications listed above. A data model can be built externally and fed into the tool.**

After reading the data into a pandas.DataFrame, the **cdm_mapper** will map observed variables and its associated metadata from a data model or models combination to the standardized C3S CDS Common Data Model (CDM_) format.
