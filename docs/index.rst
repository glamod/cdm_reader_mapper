Marine data file reader toolbox documentation
---------------------------------------------

The **cdm** toolbox is a python3_ tool designed for both

* to read data files compliant with a user specified data model.
* to map observed meteorological variables and its associated metadata from a data model (schema_) to the C3S CDS Common Data Model (CDM_) format or **imodel** as called in this tool

It was developed with the initial idea of reading data from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS_) stored in the International Maritime Meteorological Archive (IMMA_) data format.

The tool has been further enhanced to account for any marine meteorological data format, provided that this data meets the following specifications:

-	Data is stored in a human-readable manner: ASCII_.
-	Data is organized in single line reports (e.g. rows of observations separated by a delimiter like .csv).
-	Reports have a coherent internal structure that can be modelized.
-	Reports are fixed width or field delimited types.
-	Reports can be organized in sections, in which case each section can be of different types (fixed width of delimited).

The **mdf_reader** uses the information provided in a `data model`_ to read meteorological data into a python pandas.DataFrame_, with the column names and data types set according to each data element’s description specified in the data model or **schema**. In addition to reading, the **mdf_reader** validates data elements against the **schema** provided.

This tool outputs a python object with the following attributes:

1.	A pandas.DataFrame_ (DF) with the data values.
2.	A `boolean pandas`_ DF with the data validation mask.
3.	A dictionary_ with a simplified version of the input data model.

The reader allows for basic transformations of the data. This feature includes `basic numeric data decoding`_ (base36, signed_overpunch) and numeric data conversion (scale and offset).

Several data models have been added to the tool including the IMMA schema:

.. code-block:: console

    from mdf_reader-data_models.library import imma1

.. note:: **Data from other data models than those already available can be read, providing that this data meets the basic specifications listed above. A data model can be built externally and fed into the tool.**
